# Stock_analysis

1) Purpose:
    The purpose of this project was to take this data set of stocks and differing stock price attributes, and create a way to organize the data from the stocks into a nice readable chart summarizing the "return" pecentage and "total daily volume" of each stock individually. After creting a code that will allow us to search for one specific stock, we wanted to create a code that would allow us to run all of the stocks and therefore do a comparison for each year we have data for. After being able to run a comparison chart for all the stocks and stock data, the challange here was to refractor our code, or edit the current code to make the analysis more streamline and efficient. The hope for this is to have the program run at an even faster rate than the old code, by using less steps and memory for the computer to process. 
    
2) Results:
    After running the code and seeing the results, we can see that there was a downfall of stock permormance after looking at the statistics from the 2017 year to the 2018 year. During the 2018 year around 80% of the stocks had a decrease in the total volume of stock performance. This aside, when looking at our original vs refractored code we can see a few changes that allowed us to find this result in a much faster manner.

  By creating a ticker index and setting it to 0 we allowed the tickers variable to have a numerical base from which to begin the loop and adding data for each ticker to. We also were able to speed up the time of the running code by shortening the amount of times the code had to run. By getting rid of the inner loop we only had the computer run one loop at a time, shortening the time and amount of times for which the data was looped and therefore compiled.

3) Advantages and Disadvantages:
    I think that there are obvious reasons that refactoring code can be advantageous to the user. It makes things more sleek and simplified. By refactoring code we take out any extra lines and variables that arent completely necessary to the code and the function we are trying to perform. It cleans up the code and makes it much more organized and easier to use and read for other coders using the program. Refactoring code also allows for easier refactoring in the future. In case we need to add something else it will be much easier to see where we need to add something. 

    Some disadvantages to refactoring code would be making sure you kept a copy of the original! I definitly had much trouble trying to make this work. When trying to refactor code and make it more streamline we actually were added more to the code and by adding more aspects to a scrpit allows for more errors to occur. It is really finding what works together because a lot of the time I would feel confident that it was going to work but continuously kept getting errors. It is very much an artwork finding what works together when writing code. 
    
     Some Pros and Cons to refactoring the original script is that it did in fact allow the code to run substantially faster. The code was a bit longer and had more elements involved but the function of it ran more efficiently. The old code however was a bit simpler and didnt require as much tinkering. It felt a lot more generic in the way it was written, a little easier to comprehend and spot out clues and areas that made more sense to me at least.
